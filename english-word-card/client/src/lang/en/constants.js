    I have read an article about how learning English words and first advice had been just create group cards with English words 
    and on a backside a native language words. It better use cards, which have image around words. 
    If you don't remember some word you just click on the card and see russian word. 
    So that is pushed me to create this application and I have done it, but while not all cards have images, because I do it myself. 
    I would say that it's a beta version. Good luck with learning English words!`,
